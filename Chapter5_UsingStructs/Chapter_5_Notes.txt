Structs are basically the same as in C
Can instantiate them using:
let (mut) user1 =  User {
    active: true,
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    sign_in_count: 1,
};

user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com);

Can also use Field Init Shorthand

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username,
        email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

you can pass slices &str to a struct, but you will be yelled at because you ...
...generally want the struct to have complete ownership of the string


rust has automatic referencing and dereferencing so that way
you don't have to use . vs -> depending on whether you have a pointer or not


you CAN hav multiple impl blocks
